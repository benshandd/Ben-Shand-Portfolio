                        <p work>This textbook teaches complex mathematics with a hyperfocus on machine-learning. Usually the math taught in this book is dispersed between an array of classes, but this book teaches them in a succinct and concise manner so the reader is only introduced to topics specifically needed to understand machine-learning. Deisenroth introduces you to the fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine-learning; this includes linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decomposition, vector calc, optimization, probability and statistics. Overall, it is a pretty complex and heavy book but is great for anyone with a mathematical background and an interest in its application in machine-learning. This book is also published by The Cambridge University Press, take that as you will.</p>
